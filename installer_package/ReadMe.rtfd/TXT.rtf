\cf2 Info\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs32 \cf2 pinpoint is a script that is able to find the location of your Mac using Google's GeoLocation APIs. In order to use Google's GeoLocation APIs you need to obtain an API key. As of July 16th 2018 you also need to enable billing on your account for your API key aka Project. As far as I can see you get a $200 per month credit and this should be enough for 10,000 uses of Geolocation, Geocoding and Elevation APIs\'a0

\f1\i0 . See\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/jelockwood/pinpoint/wiki"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Wiki}}.\
This version is a completely written from scratch replacement for the now deprecated original python version written by Clayton Burlison. See\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/clburlison/pinpoint"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 https://github.com/clburlison/pinpoint}}\'a0Clayton has kindly given his express permission for me to re-use the name of his original project and to design mine as a drop-in replacement.\
Clayton's version relied heavily on Apple's Location Services API which sadly as of High Sierra 10.13.4 Apple changed so that it became impossible to use in an automated fashion. This version as mentioned has been written from scratch and does not use Location Services at all and hence is able to work - even in Mojave 10.14.
